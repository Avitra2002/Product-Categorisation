,"Why is it that the paynow function reveals how much cash i have in the screen while i am doing the payment?  1. There are so many customers standing  behind me while i am doing the payment.  2. The paynow QR was placed on the wall. As i am paying, the barber was walking behind me. Making me wonder if she strategically put it there.  3. Overall, it always makes me hesitate and think twice before using that function.  4. Isnt it awkward that i have to keep turning around to prevent people from looking into my screen?",,PayNow,,,,
