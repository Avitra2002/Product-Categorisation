Since then, I have had multiple RM servicing my account. With the most recent one being Zhi Qiang. I have actually given feedback to DBS about his lack of proactiveness and slow in responding. He does not provide information and options readily. Many times, I have to find out about the possibilities and then ask him about it. I am not sure if it's because I am not high net worth enough or is he just not as competent.    The latest being a request from me this morning - asking him how I can sell a US share that has been delisted from Nasdaq. We were having a message exchange on whats app and then he went quiet. I reached out again about 30mins ago and there is an auto message saying that he's on block leave. He could have mentioned that he is on block leave while we were chatting this morning.    Can I please request again to change the RM. It may be difficult to move my funds from DBS but it's always possible, it just takes time. I just need a good and responsive RM.  #2nd Email: Thank you for responding. Appreciate it. Brian has helped me with the request on selling a delisted US stock. However, I am still waiting for him/the team to come back on the request which I have asked Zhiqiang previously. I have also mentioned that to Sophia.   I would also like to share my comments on the 'service' from your Treasures team. I am not sure if the team is relatively young or they are just overworked and unhappy. While Brian did solve my issue on the US stock, the way he liaised with me on whats app was rather 'not ideal'. I would like to think that he did not do that intentionally. But maybe it's the way that he responds. (Actually Zhi qiang responds similarly too). Maybe they need to be trained how they should respond on whats app. Because it's just words without audio, the choice of words and structuring of the sentences should be used with more tact I reckon.  \",\n",

I wrote to my RM and he hasn't replied either (this happens often). There have been several such instances over the past couple of years.  Over the last year or so, I have moved my investments out to a private firm called GYC, my credit card relationship out to Citi, Health and Life Insurance out to private agents and brokerage relationship out to Tiger Brokers - I'm sure my RM is able to see this activity in your systems but has not really done much about any of it. I am now very close to moving my primary banking relationship out to another bank as well.
